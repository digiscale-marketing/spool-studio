Content and asset operations platform for creative teams.

Plan, produce, review, approve, and publish client content from a single workspace. Built for agencies managing multiple clients with recurring content cycles.

## Features

**Calendar** — Month, week, and day views with drag-to-reschedule. Overlays client contract periods, content assets, and upload queue items. Supports recurring events.

**Kanban Board** — Drag-and-drop content production pipeline. Track status from draft through approval. Filter by client or team member. It is

**Asset Library** — Central repository for reels and posters. Upload, download, version history, comments, and activity logs. Inline previews.

**Approval Workflow** — Approve, reject, or request revisions on assets. Comment threads per asset. Full approval history with activity logging.

**Client Portal** — Token-based, read-only interface for clients to review assets, leave comments, approve or request revisions. No client account required.

**Content Planner** — Service cycles with weekly content plans. Automated asset numbering and publication records.

**Upload Queue** — Scheduled uploads with R2 presigned URLs. Processing states, retry, and cancellation.

**Dashboard** — Command palette search (Ctrl/Cmd+K), notifications bell with unread badge, global search across clients and assets.

**Auth & Security** — JWT with token versioning, password reset, team invitations, rate limiting, security headers, report-only CSP. Portal tokens are hashed at rest.

**Notifications** — In-app notifications via SSE. Email through Mailgun. Per-user preference controls.

**Reporting** — PDF client reports with asset summaries and publication history.

**Ask Spool AI** — A secure, conversational assistant that drives the app
("move this asset to review", "show approvals for client X"). Each user
connects their own AI provider/model/key (encrypted at rest, managed from
Settings → Ask Spool AI). Chat never bypasses authorization — every action
flows through the existing API with the user's own session, with injection
guardrails and RBAC that fails closed. See `docs/CHAT_HARNESS.md`.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 24+ (needed for oxlint anti-slop plugin)
- PostgreSQL 15+
- pnpm

### Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> spool-studio
cd spool-studio
pnpm install
```

### Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWTs |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) |

Optional — storage, email, and debug variables are listed in `.env.example`.

For Ask Spool AI there is no shared API key: each user connects their own
provider/model/key from **Settings → Ask Spool AI** (`/dashboard/ai`). Keys are
encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM, derived from `JWT_SECRET`) and only ever shown
masked. Optional `AI_PROVIDER` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env vars
act only as a server fallback for users without a configured key.

### Database

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

Seed development data (3 users, 2 clients, 14 assets):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed.ts
```

Reset the database completely:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/fresh-db.ts
```

### Develop

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Testing

Unit and integration tests (Vitest — 21 files, 175 tests):

```bash
pnpm test
```

End-to-end tests (Playwright — 8 spec files):

```bash
npx playwright install
pnpm test:e2e
```

Before submitting changes, run the full check suite:

```bash
nvm use 24
pnpm lint
npx oxlint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```
